# New Chain Requests

The following requirements are needed for Across to consider adding support for a new chain. Across intends to support as many chains as possible to provide the best bridging, LP and relaying experience for users. However, each new chain requires significant investment, and these requirements are set to ensure that the benefit to Across Users, LPs and Relayers outweigh the development, security and operational costs of adding a new chain.&#x20;

These requirements are subject to change as the EVM and Layer 2 ecosystem evolves. Meeting these requirements is the first step in evaluation and does not guarantee support.

## **Hard Requirements**

The below are non-negotiable and are a pre-requisite to any consideration.

* EVM chain with a canonical token and message bridge to mainnet
* 30D MA TVL of chain > $50M
* â‰¥ 2 independent RPC node providers
* Dedicated support channel containing technical members of the new chain with priority support commitment to advise on contract development and debug data quality and/or disagreements between RPC providers

## **Strong Guidelines**

The below are unlikely to be negotiable, but may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

* 30D MA bridging volume to/from chains, on all bridges, for tokens and chains that Across supports > $2M
* 30D MA unique bridging addresses (by recipient address) to/from chain, on all bridges, for tokens and chains that Across supports > 1000

## Bonus

The below are nice-to-have features that can positively influence consideration.&#x20;

* Token grant for Across DAO that it will distribute to users for each transfer on Across to new chain (either chain governance token, or protocol token) to attract and incentivize users
