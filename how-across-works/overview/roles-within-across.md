# Roles within Across

### User

A user is someone who bridges assets between L2s and L1 with Across. Users pay relayers and liquidity providers in order to send their tokens instantly across networks that support their token. You can find the step by step for users [here](https://docs.across.to/how-to-use-across/bridging).&#x20;

### Liquidity Provider

A liquidity provider or LP is an actor who deposits assets into one of the pools on [Across.to/pool](https://across.to/pool). Liquidity Providers insure user funds in exchange for fees. You can find the step-by-step process for liquidity providers [here](https://docs.across.to/how-to-use-across/providing-liquidity).&#x20;

### **Relayer**&#x20;

Relayers give out short-term token loans to Users in exchange for fees. Relayers fulfill deposit requests by sending the depositor their desired token on their requested “destination chain”. Relayers will send the recipient the full deposit amount minus a relayer fee, meaning that they will keep the relayer fee as an incentive for crediting the depositor funds. You can read up on running a relayer [here](https://docs.across.to/v/developer-docs/developers/running-a-relayer).&#x20;

### Dataworker

Dataworkers support the stability and healthy functioning of the system by refunding relayers and moving system assets between networks.
